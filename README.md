# HCL AppScan DAST Github Action
Your code is better and more secure with HCL AppScan.

The HCL AppScan DAST Github Action enables you to run dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) against your application. The DAST scan identifies security vulnerabilities in your code and stores the results in AppScan on Cloud.

# Notable Features

## 1. Ephemeral Presence
When this optional feature is enabled, a temporary instance of [AppScan Presence](https://help.hcltechsw.com/appscan/ASoC/Presence1.html) is deployed within the runner. This instance of the AppScan Presence will be used for conducting the DAST scan. Once the scan is complete, this instance of AppScan Presence gets automatically deleted from AppScan on Cloud. 

![Ephemeral Presence drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5158535/231660384-557c6567-d513-40d8-8978-469eb5dd2ecc.png)

This feature is useful for running a DAST scan against a temporary instances of your web application that is also deployed within the runner itself which may not be accessible from other locations. To turn on this feature, simply set ephemeral_presence = true.

## 2. Auto Scan Cancellation
In the event of a user cancelling an action workflow midway through a DAST scan, this action will also automatically cancel the same scan in AppScan on Cloud, thereby freeing up your scan queues.

## 3. Auto embed of GITHUB SHA in AppScan on cloud reports
The Github SHA associated to the action will be embedded in AppScan on Cloud in the following locations:
- Scan name (Only if scan_name is not set in the configuration) 
- Issue comment
- Generated report under the notes section

## 4. Issue count by severity overview
Issue count are displayed in github workflow logs

## 5. Auto download of scan result into scan artifacts
Scan report (.html) is automatically generated and sent to github workflow overview page

# Usage
## Register
If you don't have an account, register on [HCL AppScan on Cloud (ASoC)](https://cloud.appscan.com/) to generate your API key and API secret.

## Setup
1. Generate your API key and API secret on [the API page](https://cloud.appscan.com/main/apikey).
- The API key and API secret map to the `asoc_key` and `asoc_secret` parameters for this action. Store the API key and API secret as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in your repository.

2. Create the application in ASoC. 
- The application ID in ASoC maps to application_id for this action.
